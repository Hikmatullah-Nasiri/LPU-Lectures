Reliable in all situations
Designed for multi-purpose use, Rapid seed drill is perfectly suited to sow a number of different crops (cereals, alfalfa, sorgho, forage grass), and is a reliable machine in all situations: after plowing, no tillage or simplified tillage.

Rapid is available in various working width: 3, 4, 6 or 8 m.

3 and 4 m wide Rapid models are equipped with a mechanical seed transmission system (using gravity), whereas 6 and 8 m wide models have a pneumatic system.

Rapid can be equipped with various front tools to finish preparing the seedbed:<br />
                                            Nutrient placement during drilling
This drill can also be equipped with a fertilizer distributor which inserts nutrients in between the two disks in order to ensure better root development, faster growth and better nutrient use efficiency.

        Save up to 50% on seeds!
The ingenuity of the Rapid relies on its outstanding seeding depth control system, even at very high speed and whatever the type of soil, allowing optimum density of plants, and significant seed savings. This is especially the case when the seeds are highly sensitive to sowing depth (alfalfa and grasses). Seed savings can then reach up to 40-50% of what our customers used before: Huge savings when it comes to sowing several thousand acres!
