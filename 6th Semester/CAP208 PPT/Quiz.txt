1.Data Transfer can be handle by 
Programmed I/O
Interrupt Initiated IO
None 
Both 

2.DMA 
 Direct Memory Accesss 
 Direct Mode Accesss

3.Each data transfer is initiated by an instruction in
the program
Programmed IO 

4.computer does not check the flag.
It continue to perform its task.

5.that interrupt the CPU provides the branch information
vectored interrupt 

6.all capable of generating the interrupt

7.Devices with high speed transfer are given higher
priority 

8  priority can be done in two ways
9
Stack

       DMA Controller and CPU both access Memory 
Upon receiving a GO Command DMA performs

nested subroutines
nested interrupt services

Interface
Decodes the device address (device code)
- Decodes the commands (operation)
- Provides signals for the peripheral controller
- Synchronizes the data flow and supervises 

Separate I/O read/write control lines in addition to memory read/write 				control lines

 Many computers use a common single bus system for both memory and I/O interface units


Processor provide a function code in the control lines  


There are four types of command control ,status ,data output and data input I/O BUS is for information transfers between CPU	and I/O devices through their I/O interface


MEMORY BUS  is for information transfers between CPU and the MM
